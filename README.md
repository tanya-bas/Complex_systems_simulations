# Modeling of Complex Systems

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for simulating and analyzing various complex systems using computational models. Each notebook explores a different system or phenomenon, providing code, explanations, and visualizations.

## Contents

- **Airport model.ipynb**  
  Simulates airport security queues using discrete event simulation. Models the flow of passengers through security, including additional screening and queue management, to analyze waiting times and bottlenecks.

- **Cellular automata.ipynb**  
  Implements a cellular automata simulation to study the dynamics of bacteria and food growth on a grid. Includes rules for food growth, diffusion, consumption, and bacteria reproduction, with visualization of the evolving system.

- **Fire Spread Modeling.ipynb**  
  Simulates the spread of fire across a real worls landscape in British Columbia, using cellular automata to study how fire propagates under different conditions  (wind, density, temperature, humidity). Inclues percolation analysis and theoretical modeling using renormalization group theory to derive mathematical relationships between wind strength and fire spread probability. Evaluates 3 fire mitigation stategies. 

- **Berlin Traffic Simulation.ipynb**  
  Simulates a traffic congestion in Berlin using OSMnx and NetworkX, with 73% alignment with historical traffic congestion data. Contains a theoretical model (graph theory) for analytical estimations of traffic dynamics

## Usage

Open any notebook in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to explore the models. Each notebook is self-contained and includes code, explanations, and visualizations.
